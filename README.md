This project's objective is to write an unstyled website that will
eventually become my main website.

I will use the skills of file structure, links, alt best practice,
and the HTML I have learned so far to build a template for the 
website I aspire to have in the future when my knowledge builds more

I want to create the structure and fill the content that will
inhabit the final page.
